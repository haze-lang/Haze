# The Haze Programming Language
Haze is a research programming language aimed at exploring existing and new ideas in a conventional manner. The initial focus is delimited control constructs similar to Scheme/Racket's `reset` and `shift` in C-style (in contrast with Lisp-style) imperative paradigm, with a static and strong type system.

## Hello World
```
Main : Unit -> Unit
Main
{
    PrintLine "Hello, World!"
}
```
See [Hello World Tutorial](Tutorial/Hello%20World.md) for a brief explanation of above program.

For an overview of the language and its features, see [Overview of Haze](Tutorial/Overview.md).
